<p>O my child, come home again; How I beg you to come home.<br />Though your sin be deep and dark, and your burden hard to bear,<br />Still the Lord of all will forgive you, and accept you in His grace.<br />For the heart of God is deep and wide,<br />Boundless and eternal His love.<br /> <br />O my child, come home again; How I beg you to come home.<br />How He searches every day, for the children of His heart.<br />Every night the Lord leaves the doorway open wide for their return,<br />And He longs for them to come back home,<br />All the ones who left Him behind.<br /> <br />O my child, come home again; How I beg you to come home,<br />Though the whip has stung your back, in the tender hands of God,<br />All your suffering path can be lightened, and the Lord can ease your pain,<br />Come and rest within the Father's heart,<br />O my children quickly come home.</p>
