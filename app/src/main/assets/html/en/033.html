<p>We're marching to the blessed land of Canaan with delight,<br />We're leaving all our heavy burdens here.<br />At last we are released and free from being slaves to sin,<br /> <br />Chorus:<br />We're coming to the blessed spring of life.<br />Coming to the spring where living water flows;<br />In glory we'll be living evermore.<br />Going to the land where freely flows the spring,<br />In glory we'll be living evermore.<br /> <br />O guide us with your pillars, Lord, of fire and of cloud,<br />O give us paths to follow with our lives.<br />The moment that we cross the Jordan River is at hand,<br />We're coming to the blessed spring of life.<br />Coming to the spring where living water flows;<br />In glory we'll be living evermore.<br />Going to the land where freely flows the spring,<br />In glory we'll be living evermore.<br /> <br />Our thirsting hearts receive with joy the manna from above,<br />Your precious food will always be our strength<br />So if the future finds us lacking we will not despair<br />We're coming to the blessed spring of life.<br />Coming to the spring where living water flows;<br />In glory we'll be living evermore.<br />Going to the land where freely flows the spring,<br />In glory we'll be living evermore.</p>
