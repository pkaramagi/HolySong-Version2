<p>Chase away the power of Satan, far away beyond the land and sea;<br />Build for God a boundless Kingdom, giving joy and liberty to all.<br />Come, ye people all around the world, let's unit into one;<br />Spreading forth the glory of the Father, and His great will forevermore.<br /> <br /> <strong>Chorus:</strong><br /> Unite, Unite, let's unite into one<br /> Bring about one nation uniting all the people of the world.</p>
<p>Raise the white cross on our banner, high upon Mt. Everest it waves;<br />In the blue Pacific waters, cleanse the sword that brought the victory.<br />Come, ye people all around the world, let's unite into one.<br />Now resolve to end the deep resentment, of the long centuries past<br /> <br />Build a fortress to defend the peace, on the great new heaven and new earth;<br />We will all sing 'Hallelujah,' safe within the bosom of the Lord.<br />Come, ye people all around the world, let's unite into one.<br />Share the joy and glory of Heaven, hidden so long from every eye.</p>
