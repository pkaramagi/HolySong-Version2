<p>Darkness gaining power within, tempting my soul to fall.<br />Weak is my heart, blurred are my thoughts, soon I am overcome.<br />Blind to the truth, losing the way, thinking of myself;<br />So I can see how sin began sprouting within my soul.<br />So I can see how sin began sprouting within my soul.</p>
<p>When my Lord came over to me, I would not hear His voice;<br />Blinded and deaf, closing my heart, I ran away from Him.<br />So I remained lost in desire only for myself.<br />Grieving the Lord suffered for me, going again to the cross.<br />Grieving the Lord suffered for me, going again to the cross.<br /> <br />To restore the black lonely night held by the power of sin,<br />Deserts He crossed, walking the way, climbing the rocky peaks.<br />Searching for us people of sin who deserve to die,<br />How then could I ever begin thanking the Lord for such grace?<br />How then could I ever begin thanking the Lord for such grace?<br /> <br />To defeat the power of death, fighting the realm of sin.<br />I sought the Lord, longing for Him, Bridegroom of my soul.<br />Tortured my heart, suffering alone, fighting deepest pain,<br />Finally today I greet the Lord, gaining all comfort from Him.<br />Finally today I greet the Lord, gaining all comfort from Him.<br /> <br />Joy eternal lifting my heart, swelling within my breast;<br />Now I behold, Heavenly life, glory and happiness.<br />Always before stung by my sin, I was doomed to die.<br />Finally today I am reborn, filled with abundant new life,<br />Finally today I am reborn, filled with abundant new life.<br /> <br />O my dearest Heavenly bride, now you've come home at last,<br />Deserts you crossed, searching for me, climbing the rocky peaks;<br />You persevered, faithful to me, longing for this day.<br />How you've become lovely to see through all your suffering and pain,<br />How you've become lovely to see through all your suffering and pain.<br /> <br />Come, O come, together we'll sing songs of eternal praise.<br />Taste now my love, treasure so pure, Heaven's gift for you;<br />All of my heart waited for you, yearning for this day.<br />All of my heart waited for you now I can give you my love.<br />All of my heart waited for you now I can give you my love.</p>
