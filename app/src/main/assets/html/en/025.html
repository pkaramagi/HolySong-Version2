<p>My fallen figure shames the earth;<br />Once I was born, yet never I lived,<br />Never forsaking, You came to me<br />Giving my life and breaking my chains<br />Tenderly You gathered me up;<br />Filled with love and sweating blood,<br />Ever patient, You taught me the word,<br />Carved in my heart, it forever remains.<br /> <br />Never I knew what life should be;<br />All I can do is follow your way.<br />When on the path, I stumble and fall,<br />Turning, You give the courage I need.<br />Though the path is narrow and steep;<br />Cruel thorns leave a trail of blood.<br />Still I pledge I will follow the way,<br />Follow as far as my Father will lead.<br /> <br />Freed from a sleep so deep and dark,<br />gladly I wake to knowing your will.<br />Though death may stab me time and again,<br />Nothing can change a loyal heart.<br />This I pledge, my life is for You;<br />For Your will I rush forward to die.<br />This I pledge till the struggle is done,<br />'Till we proclaim the victorious day.</p>
