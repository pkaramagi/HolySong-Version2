<p>Longing to live in deepest joy and love eternal,<br />God was ever seeking for a people all His own.<br />Who can know the yearning of His lonely broken heart?<br />Tears were falling as a river through His countless years alone.<br />Out of all the multitude there was none who knew<br />How the Father's heart was aching, grieving after man.<br /> <br />Glorious God, who started life throughout the heavens,<br />Bore the deepest torture as He saw His children die.<br />Every day He seeks the beauty lost inside our hearts,<br />Tenderly with love He leads us back to life with Him on high.<br />How many fathoms deep is His aching heart?<br />All the tears He shed for earth became an endless sea.<br /> <br />Deep from within the heart of heaven came the secret,<br />Now the mighty word, the trumpet call will surely sound.<br />But as in the time of Noah people laugh and mock,<br />Satisfied to wander aimless in the darkness underground.<br />Fearful is the time to come when the price is paid!<br />One and all will face the judgment from an angry God.<br /> <br />Quickly believe, my people quickly turn and follow!<br />You can be enfolded in the warmth of Father's heart.<br />All the joy that life can offer calls us home to Him,<br />Now He calls you to be near Him never again to be apart.<br />When at last we run to Him, how He'll cry with joy!<br />All rejoicing, all together now and evermore.</p>
