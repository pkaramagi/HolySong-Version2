<p><br />The Lord has called and I will go, where He leads me I will follow;<br />The same in sorrow as in joy; with one heart I follow my Lord.<br />For none on earth can turn me back, not even death can stop me,<br />No none on earth can turn me back, not even death can stop me.<br /> <br />To barren valleys piled with bones, I will take the living message;<br />To Sodom's foul and wretched streets, I will bear the word with love.<br />I bind my heart, my life to Yours, that it may be an offering,<br />I bind my heart, my life to Yours, that it may be an offering.<br /> <br />To You belongs our full acclaim, all glory power and honor,<br />The world's contempt I do not fear, I will gladly bear the cross.<br />Without esteem, without renown, I only wish to follow,<br />Without esteem, without renown, I only wish to follow.</p>
