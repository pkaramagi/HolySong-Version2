<p>O come my Lord; I beg You to come.<br />O come to me and live within my heart;<br />Come live in my heart so black and impure,<br />That bears the burden of my sin.<br />O come! My Lord, You are the fire that burns so bright;<br />Come burn within my heart and cleans my sins,<br />O how I pray that You will come soon;<br />Come to me O Lord, Live within my heart.<br /> <br />O come my Lord; I beg You to come.<br />Come dwell with me my altar now awaits;<br />O come to the altar waiting for you,<br />But lost and hidden by the night.<br />O come! My Lord, You are the light that fills the world;<br />Come purify my altar by Your light.<br />O how I pray that You will come soon;<br />Many altars wait, Dwell with them, O Lord.<br /> <br />O come my Lord; I beg You to come.<br />O come and bring new life to all the earth;<br />O come save the world from dying in pain;<br />Restore our sinful world.<br />O come! My Lord, You are the strength that will not change;<br />Come end our evil ways and tragic times.<br />O how I pray that You will come soon;<br />Crying my heart, Come to us, O Lord.</p>
