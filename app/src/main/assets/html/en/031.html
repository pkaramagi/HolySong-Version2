<p>Who can I go to for my help to bear my heavy cross?<br />Has not the Lord been helping me before I ever knew?<br />Because I had no strength to bear the load He gave to me,<br />Six thousand yeas of blood was shed, the thorny path prolonged.<br /> <br />Chorus:<br /> I will shoulder now the cross, and pledge I shall endure;<br /> Far beyond Golgotha's pain, now hear the victory.<br /> <br />The Lord would never give to me a cross I could not bear.<br />If I give all the strength I have I shall achieve the goal.<br />I sacrifice to do His will, no trial I cannot bear.<br />I give my life to go this way, no one can turn me back.<br /> <br />Our Father always persevered to see His will be done,<br />If all His children join the task it soon will be achieved.<br />If not, the lonely years of strife will all have been in vain.<br />No matter what, in fighting on, we'll win eternal joy.</p>
