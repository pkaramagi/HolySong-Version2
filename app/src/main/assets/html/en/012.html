<p>We shout with joy, we rise and sing! The Will of God is done!<br />A new day dawns and the dream lives; the Son of God has come!<br />Fight bravely to crush Satan; God's power will be revealed.<br />In the children of our Father, the Youth of Harmony.<br /> <br />The darkness which has covered us in Him has been dispelled.<br />The dawn breaks into daylight; we ring the morning bell.<br />Thirty billion shall live in the bright white light of truth.<br />Let us rise and march forward with Harmony of Youth.<br /> <br />As children of the Heavenly power, we march against our foe;<br />The command comes and the world bows to our True Father's own!<br />Beaming light unto the nations, we carry high our dream.<br />Let us win out for our Father, we Youth of Harmony!</p>
