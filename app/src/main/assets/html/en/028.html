<p>Sunlight beaming forth in the East, from the Fatherland;<br />Bringing tidings of a new world to families in the field.<br />Let us hasten to send the news all throughout the world,<br />Eden's glory spreading forever the hope of joy and peace.<br /> <br /><strong>Chorus:</strong><br /> Dawn, golden dawn, throughout the shining Fatherland,<br /> Tells the tidings of the rising sun that brings us life.<br /> <br />Harvest quickly men of the fields, hasten to harvest now;<br />Crops are ripened and ready to bring into the heavenly barn.<br />Saints and angels and heavenly hosts gather to speed the task;<br />All will share the harvest of joy at the banquet of our Lord.<br /> <br />When the woes of six thousand years are gone from the Father's heart,<br />Sons and daughters shall live with great joy, our True Parents' own<br />Saints and sages and men of good faith all waited for this day;<br />Loyal men of hope and fidelity yearned to see this day.</p>
