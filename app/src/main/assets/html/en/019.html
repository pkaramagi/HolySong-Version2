<p>Sing Hosannas evermore! Sing of glory evermore!<br />For the Lord has come again, Sing Hosannas evermore!</p>
<p>Heaven dances at the sound, All His angels whirl around.<br />All creation joining in, Dances at the joyful sound.<br /> <br />See the new Jerusalem, Coming now upon the earth.<br />For the day is here at last, Now the Lord is come at last.<br /> <br />Brightly burn O Fire of Faith! Burn so brightly everywhere.<br />Light of hope, burn today, Kindling every faithful heart.<br /> <br />Land of Egypt, land of woe, Waiting for the Lord's return.<br />Soon the day will come at last, When the Rose of Sharon blooms.<br /> <br />March along, march along, Have no fear, but march along;<br />For you go to victory, Heaven's soldiers, march along.<br /> <br />Praise the Lord, O praise the Lord! Praise the glorious Lord of all,<br />To the Lord of truth and love, Sing to Him eternal praise.<br /> <br />Sing Hosannas evermore! Sing of glory evermore!<br />For the Lord has come again, Sing Hosannas evermore!</p>
