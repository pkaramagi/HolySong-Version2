<p>I pledge I will go, I pledge I will go;<br />Go as my Father has gone.<br />Tears fall on the path,<br />Lonely and silent the path of the Father,<br />Going to suffer the way of the Cross.<br />Ready to follow His will.<br />I pledge I will go forward to Him;<br />Ready to follow His will,<br />I pledge I will go forward to Him.<br /> <br />I'll follow the way, I'll follow the way;<br />Follow the path of my Lord.<br />Though thorny the path,<br />Now persevere as the brightness is growing,<br />On to the victory and glorious crown,<br />Giving my body and soul,<br />I'll follow the Lord all of the way;<br />Giving my body and soul, I'll follow the Lord all of the way.<br /> <br />I'm ready to serve, I'm ready to serve.<br />Serving my Father's desire,<br />Trials darken the path,<br />Deep in my heart the desire of the ages,<br />Fighting until we come home to the Lord,<br />Satan will bow in defeat,<br />I'm ready to serve all of my life;<br />Satan will bow in defeat, I'm ready to serve all of my life.</p>
