<p>The Lord into His garden comes;<br />The spices yield a rich perfume;<br />The lilies grow and thrive, the lilies grow and thrive.<br />Refreshing showers of grace divine,<br />From the Father flow to every vine,<br />And make the dead revive, and make the dead revive.<br /> <br />Oh that this dry and barren ground<br />In springs of water may abound;<br />A fruitful soil become, a fruitful soil become.<br />The desert blossoms as the rose,<br />When the Saviour conquers all his foes,<br />And makes His people one, and makes His people one.<br /> <br />Come brethren you that love the Lord,<br />And taste the sweetness of His word;<br />In Father's ways go on, in Father's ways go on,<br />Our trouble and our trials here,<br />Will only make us richer there,<br />When we arrive at home, when we arrive at home.</p>
