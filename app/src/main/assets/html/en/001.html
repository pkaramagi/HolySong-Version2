<p>Now the light of glory arises like the sun that shines on high;<br />Now awaken into freedom, O revive, you spirits, O revive!<br />Wake the mountains and the valleys; bring alive the springs of the earth.<br />Light the world forever with the Light of your rebirth.<br />Light the world forever with the Light of your rebirth.<br /> <br />We are called to bring back the glory to the life of God above;<br />Now the Lord in His greatness fills the universe with tender love,<br />Ever seeking souls awakened, ever calling them to be free.<br />How shall I attend Him who is calling to me?<br />How shall I attend Him who is calling to me?<br /> <br />From the dark of death I awaken and rejoice to live in grace;<br />When the one who came to save me holds me tenderly in His embrace;<br />How can I return the blessing? Though in all my life I will try.<br />I can never stop feeling how unworthy am I.<br />I can never stop feeling how unworthy am I!</p>
