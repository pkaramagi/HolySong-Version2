<p>Grace filling me with golden light, measureless blessing divine;<br />God gives eternal life to me, perfect rejoicing is mine.<br /> <br /> <b>Chorus:</b><br /> Glorious the song ringing in my heart for my Father above;<br /> Gratefully I give offering to Him, triumph and glorious love.<br /> <br />Joy surging like an ocean wave, flowing so deep in my soul;<br />Hope rises as I go in praise, knowing that man will be whole<br /> <br />High, limitless eternal life, touching the top of the sky;<br />Praise filling every part of me blessing that never will die.<br /> <br />You've chosen me to do Your will, thankful, I vow to he true;<br />I'm pledging in my heart of hearts; Father, my life is for You.</p>
