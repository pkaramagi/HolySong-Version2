<p><br />Through silent darkness comes, His constant clearest voice.<br />His words of truth and life wake us up from sleep.<br /> <br /><strong>Chorus:</strong><br /> Glory, O Glory, O Glorious Lord,<br /> Welcome, O Welcome, O Welcome Him now,<br /> Giving all you have and join with our Lord,<br /> One with our God, Sharing love and beauty evermore.<br /> For now the day all men desire Day of celebration is at hand!<br /> <br />Sunrise and morning comes, we rise up in its light,<br />Spread forth the word of good, giving all your strength.<br /> <br />All holy children come, new days have dawned at last,<br />March forward one and all, quickly now unite.</p>
