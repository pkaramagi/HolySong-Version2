<p>Where are His children who answered the call<br />Of the archangel sounding afar?<br />People who trembled as lightning flashed,<br />Blazing the sky from the East to the West,<br />Dark is the sun, dim is the moon,<br />Thousands of stars falling to darkness;<br />Where are the ones blessed with new life,<br />Liberated from the dead?<br /> <br />Now we behold a new heaven and earth,<br />Holy Jerusalem, standing anew;<br />After our search of six thousand years,<br />Eden rejoices to welcome us home.<br />All of our tears, wipe them away;<br />Sorrowful sighs, we will not need them;<br />Where is my Lord, He who returns?<br />Where is Heaven's glorious One?<br /> <br />Once He departed by way of the cross,<br />Now He returns and He suffers again;<br />One way is given to me our Lord;<br />Follow the path to the bottom of hell.<br />Glorious star, Lebanon's light,<br />Shining on all, lighting the ages;<br />There is the great city of God,<br />Where the sun arises and shines.<br /> <br />Come in rejoicing and look to the light,<br />See how the darkness is rolling away;<br />Out of the few come a multitude;<br />Joyfully building the city of God.<br />Children of life stream thru the gates,<br />Close to His heart, singing to please Him;<br />Raising the white cross to the sky,<br />Praising our eternal new life.</p>
