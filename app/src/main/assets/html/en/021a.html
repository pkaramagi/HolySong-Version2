<p>So many saints have journeyed this road;<br />No one could make the pathway complete;<br />Now at last He opens the way,<br />Calls us to come, waits for us all;<br />All the host of men and angels<br />Failed to do the will of Heaven;<br />Now the Lord is still awaiting,<br />You alone must answer His call.<br /> <br />Glory concealed, He suffers again,<br />Wrongly accused of lowliest crimes,<br />Though His path is thorny and long<br />Still I must go, follow my Lord;<br />In His presence Eden blossoms,<br />So a dungeon may be Eden;<br />Just to be with my beloved,<br />I'd endure all torture and pain.<br /> <br />I give my pledge to go with my Lord,<br />I too shall walk the way He has gone;<br />Though I meet the shadow of death,<br />He is my life, I am His own;<br />Strong desire swells within me,<br />Leading me to go be with Him;<br />In my heart such strong desire,<br />Not a one can stand in my way.<br /> <br />Shameless disgrace! You tie Him in chains<br />Scorning my Lord, you lead Him away;<br />Words and pictures witness your sin;<br />All men shall, judgment shall fall;<br />Blind officials ridicule Him,<br />Still the high priests; mock the Saviour;<br />Do you mean to force upon us<br />Tragedy and suffering again?</p>
