<p>O, Light of Grace, shining above,<br />Lighting my dim shadowed way,<br />O, Light of Grace, easing my pain,<br />You have shown that God is love.<br /> <br /><strong>Chorus:</strong><br /> <br /> I'll give my life, and my love, unto the one God of love.<br /> <br />Though clouds may come, hiding His face,<br />Hiding the smile of my God,<br />Though clouds may come,<br />Still He is there,<br />Shining brightly, Cod is love.<br /> <br />Amid the storm, tossed on the sea,<br />Beacon of hope, guiding me.<br />Amid the storm, shelter is near,<br />Trust in Him for God is love.<br /> <br />All things decay, passing away,<br />Only the light shall remain;<br />All things decay; still there is One,<br />True and faithful, God is love.</p>
