<p>See Lord Jesus bent in prayer, in the garden late at night,<br />See Lord Jesus bent in prayer, in the garden late at night.<br />See Him crying sweating blood watch it mingle with His tears;<br />Twelve disciples all asleep, even Peter nods and snores.<br />Iscariot comes with a kiss, hands Him over He is betrayed.<br />How could it be? Tragic sight innocent Lord precious Lord.<br />Twelve disciples watch from afar, everyone is running away.<br />Jesus alone captured and chained; soldiers lead Him to the prison.<br />Frightened Peter runs from the scene; with his tunic hides his face;<br />Look at Peter treacherous man, now pretends he does not know.<br />He who made the lame leap for joy, He who made the blind man see,<br />He who freely walked on the waves, where are all those miracles now?<br /> <br />See Lord Jesus bent in shame, see Him bear His heavy cross,<br />See Lord Jesus bent in shame, see Him bear His heavy cross.<br />Spent, exhausted, body and soul, now He stumbles and He falls;<br />Whipped from behind, driven along, Jesus treated just like a cow,<br />Where are His men? Where are the twelve? Jesus now is standing alone.<br />Not even one man is there bearing the cross for his Lord.<br />Tho' the crowd may pity a thief, freeing sinful men of this world,<br />Who'd volunteer to take His place, take the cross for God's son Jesus?<br />How very sad, how very sad, mighty Father shedding tears;<br /> <br />Lost and betrayed, lost and betrayed, all the Father's hopes are gone.<br /> <br />Even the most ignorant men have a shred of common sense;<br /> <br />Who can see the Father's despair, who can share His suffering pain?<br /> See Lord Jesus on the cross, nails are hammered through His hands,<br />See Lord Jesus on the cross, nails are hammered through His hands.<br />What kind of sin did He commit, this, the only Son of God?<br />Like a pure innocent sheep, He is dying, dying for you.<br />Father above He cannot watch; When He turns His face from His Son.<br />"My God, my God" Jesus cries "Why do you now forsake me?"<br />Twelve disciples shared all His ways, still were deaf and blind to His heart<br />All gone to waste, all gone to waste, Providence of God is broken<br />No use now to cry and repent, all repentance comes too late.<br />To prepare His coming again, sacrifices must be found.<br />All the faithful shedding their blood, spilling for two thousand years.<br />All this bloodshed, salvation's price, for three billion men of today.</p>
