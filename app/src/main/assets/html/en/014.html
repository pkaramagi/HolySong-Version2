<p>We are the youth, soldiers of the truth, called by our God on high;<br />Now is the time, march to the world, sounding the battle cry!<br />Too long the dark night of sin held in fear the people of the world,<br />We'll drive the darkness away, bringing in the new day.<br /> <br /><strong> Chorus:</strong><br /> Lift high! Lift high! The banner of Truth on high;<br /> March forward crossing the sea, to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth all are made anew, blessed by the light of God;<br />Evil and sin vanish away, burned in the holy fire.<br />This is the land of the heart, every people living as one,<br />Glad voices filling the land, sing a joyful song.<br /> <br />Proud is my heart bursting with my hope, we are the youth of God;<br />See how we go moving as one, marching at His command.<br />Five colors shine in the ranks, every people, every race of man.<br />We'll shake the heavens and earth, with our victory song.</p>
