<p>Beautiful morning sunrise, calm above the land of our hope;<br />Robed in white chosen people, fighting for the land of God.<br />Towering high the snow white mountain stands aloft in majesty.<br />Ruling with power over the world, shining o'er the universe.<br />Marching on Heavenly soldiers, marching on with His love,<br />Uniting in life eternal with our God in Heaven and earth.<br /> <br />Heavenly soldiers fighting strongly for the victory;<br />Bringing lost souls to harvest from the fallen world of fear,<br />Freely giving love and beauty to them from our Parents' Heart.<br />Spreading the word over the world, rescuing the family of God.<br />Marching on Heavenly soldiers, marching on with His love,<br />Uniting in life eternal w*h our God in Heaven and earth.<br /> <br />Sanctified, brave crusaders, join in our True Parents' fight;<br />Lifting high the rod of iron, smashing evils of the world!<br />Now restoring Eden's glory, on the earth eternally,<br />Praising our God, Heavenly Father, giving joy to comfort His heart<br />Marching on Heavenly soldiers, marching on with His love.<br />Uniting in life eternal with our God in Heaven and earth.</p>
