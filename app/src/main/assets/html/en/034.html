<p>When I behold the Lord of all, my old self dies away.<br />So dies the world of sinfulness giving birth to good.<br />Soon a new self emerges, clear and bright and pure;<br />Come and behold the new life, heaven and earth reborn.<br /> <br />Now I behold Jerusalem, city of loveliness,<br />Gently descending from above, ever to be my own.<br />Joy never ending is with me, long as the Lord is near;<br />Joy ever flows in sweetness, river of precious life.<br /> <br />Kingdom of God eternal fervently I desired;<br />heavenly rays so softy fall, shining the Sun of Grace.<br />Springing forth in ripeness, fruit of the Tree of Life,<br />Torment of doubt is over, gone is the shadow of death.<br /> <br />Torturing every part of me, sinfulness rules my soul.<br />Still God can raise me purified, giving creation to me.<br />Letting me live in his palace, shining with golden light;<br />Boundless His love and kindness, boundless His love for me!</p>
