<p>O, my little lambs, wandering on the lonely plain.<br />Someday you may fall, overcome by your despair.<br />Weak, wounded soul, no one will come to comfort you;<br />Alone, you have no one to love you, no one to bring the truth.<br /> <br />Oh, my little lambs, here is the One who heals your sins.<br />O, see how He carries the cross and leads the way.<br />Come, follow Him, He is the shepherd you have sought.<br />Without Him you tremble in weakness, far from the path of life.<br /> <br />Oh, my little lambs, hunger and thirst may torture you,<br />Receive Him completely with all that you have.<br />You shall be healed, Heavenly strength will fill your soul,<br />And deep boundless joy will swell within you eternally.<br /> <br />O, my little lambs, now is the time for joyful heart,<br />Sing praise to the Lord; raise your voices in strength.<br />Love all mankind, Love everyone throughout the world.<br />O give them the love that I give you, O my little lambs.</p>
