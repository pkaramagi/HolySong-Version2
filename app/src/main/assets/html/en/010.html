<p>Now I have to come to know, I've truly come to know,<br />Father, how your heart is filled with tears,<br />For your altar stands and waits for an offering never made.<br />He cries through all the ages for still no offering comes,<br />Our Father cries in loneliness for He cannot share His heart.<br /> <br />Now I have come to know, I've truly come to know,<br />Father, now I know your blessed grace;<br />For you raised me from the darkness and gave to me new life.<br />I live and stand before you, but now you cry again.<br />My Father has to say to me,<br />"Go and die now in my place."<br /> <br />Now pledging I will go, determined I will go,<br />Father, now I'm changing to Your way,<br />For no other will I follow, but go my Father's way<br />Upon Your waiting altar I kneel without a word.<br />My life shall be the sacrifice;<br />I will faithfully obey.</p>
