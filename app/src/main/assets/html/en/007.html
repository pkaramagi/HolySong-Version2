<p>Snow and cold wind of the bitter dark night,<br />Lift off the weight of your cold ruthless hand;<br />Spring breeze will chase you and bring flowery fragrances,<br />Breathing new life to the suffocated hills.<br /> <br />Though you most ruthless of winter winds blow,<br />Doomed in a moment you too shall be calmed;<br />Spring breeze will chase you and bring flowery fragrances,<br />Breathing new life to the suffocated hills.<br /> <br />Butterfly awake and you meadow lark of spring,<br />Our land has suffered this nightmare too long;<br />Spring breeze will chase you and bring flowery fragrances,<br />Breathing new life to the suffocated hills.</p>
